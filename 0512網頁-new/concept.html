            <p>
              We are designers, artists and artisans. Black & White is the
              embodiment of our values - aesthetics, hand-made, and
              sustainablity - realized in the simplest yet powerful way: black
              and white.We believe that form brings out true beauty, regardless
              of numbers of colors used, the complexity the product holds, or
              the techs employed in production. We are straight forward and
              efficient because we know that, through our hands, beauty will
              naturally follows.<br /><br />
              It’s simple, yet amazing.<br /><br />

              Based on the project, the kiln dried timber is resized, smoothed,
              shaped, and assembled in the woodworking shop that includes a
              panel saw, thicknesser, surfacer, resaw, vacuum press, moulder,

              hundreds of years.”

              All timber used within the business is sourced through Forestry
              Tasmania – a publically owned forest certified to the Australian
              Forestry Standard (AFS) for environmental, social, and economic
              sustainability and are managed and harvested in accordance with
              State and Australian government environmental regulations.<br /><br />
              “Our company is all about a sustainable product so this industry
              can have enough timber for future generations,” explains Craig.
              “We are extremely cautious about the environment and
              sustainability since most species take over 200 years for a good
              log to grow, there is a limited resource available and we are
              always looking to improve.<br /><br />” Based on the project, the

                      furniture company David Linley as a senior designer in his native
                      Britain. While still there, he got back in touch with an old friend
                      and fellow ski-bunny, Tonya, who had moved to Australia.<br />
